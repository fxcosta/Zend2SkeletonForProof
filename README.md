ZendSkeletonApplication
=======================

Introduction
------------
This is a simple, skeleton application using the ZF2 MVC layer and module
systems. This application is meant to be used as a starting place for those
looking to get their feet wet with ZF2.

Fx3costa's Note
---------------------------
This is a project just for learning and to do several tests on Zend Framework 2 and cannot
be used as a basis for future projects using that version. This project currently has routes,
services and a functional module and more.
